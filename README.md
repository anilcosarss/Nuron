# Hello everyone! ðŸ¤— 

## Bootstrap



 


#### Bootstrap was used with SCSS in this project.

My achievements were:
- Learning bootstrap
- Bootstrap attributes
- SCSS
- Hover with positions, animations
- Other SCSS attributes for my self-improvment
- Full responsive desing with Bootstrap



```diff
